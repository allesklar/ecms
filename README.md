# ECMS
The goal of this Rails Engine is to a allow the creation of a functioning, fully featured, basic CMS in minutes.

It's customized for my own needs but could be of use for somebody else.

## Installation and Usage

Five minutes to go from zero to hero!

Install the latest version of Rails and other needed gem
+ Install Ruby 2.7.2 or later
+ Install Rails 6.1.1 or later
  + `$ gem install rails`
+ Install image library -- TODO to be determined
+ Install a js runtime. For example:
  + `$ gem install therubyracer`
+ Create a new Rails application
  + `$ rails new my_app_name --database=postgresql`

  + `$ cd my_app_name`
+ Configure the locales if needed
  + If English is not the site's default language, add the following line in the config/application.rb
    + config.i18n.default_locale = :de
  + If you want to support other languages than English
    + follow the following url and copy the relevant files to the config/locales/ folder: https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails/locale
